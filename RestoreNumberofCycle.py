Restore numbers on circle
Given a list:
 a,b â€” a and b is friends
[[a, b],[a, c],[c, d],[e, f], [f, g],[f, e],[g, h], [h,b],[h, g]]
Now they are going to have dinner together, but everyone wants to seat with their friends
Like:
        a
    c       b
d              h
   e           g
        f
Output: A sequence to arrange them properly (can start from any one)
like  [c, d, e, f, g, h, b, a] or [g, h, b, a, c, d, e, f]
